# Forti-Pi
* Who?
   * Anyone! That's the entire idea here. Pi's are inexpensive and great for beginners or those of us on a tight budget.
* What?
   * Forti-Pi is a proof-of-concept for deploying a basic SIEM/XDR setup at home on dirt cheap hardware for personal security or security research
* When?
   * Initial release of the suite is slated for late December 2022!
* Where?
   * Installs on any Raspberry Pi 4 system (8GB RAM is ideal)
   * Can also work on non-ARM Linux distros (may require a bit of modding)
* Why?
   * Lowering the hardware/financial requirements for learning/labbing infosec benefits all of us and helps inspire the next generation of security researchers to push past what is considered "possible"
   * Small businesses may be unable to afford traditional SIEM/XDR products and related hardware, this helps close the gap
